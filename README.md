## Project Proposal

We will use the datasets to examine the correlation between dog size (weight and height) to dog intelligence.  Intelligence for a dog is defined as the dog's obedience (the probability of the breed to obey on the first command) and the number of repetitions needed for learning new commands (lower is better).

Dog’s have been bred for many different purposes, and although a dog breed may not be considered ‘intelligent’ in this context, that does not make them less smarter than those that score well here.  Some dog breeds were bred to not require obeying a human and relied more on independent thinking to do their purpose.

## Project Idea

Determine if there is a relationship between a dog breed's physical attributes (weight and height) and see if there is a correlation between the dog breed's obedience and 'intelligence'.  Also, determine if there is a ratio of height and weight that is correlated to higher or lower obedience and 'intelligence'.  Aso, possibly determine how dog groups (herding, working, toy, etc) are affected by these four properties.

## Dataset
[Dog Intelligence and Size from Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/canine-intelligence-and-size?select=AKC+Breed+Info.csv)

AKC Breed Info.csv
This dataset has 5 data columns (Breed, height_low_inches, height_high_inches, weight_low_lbs, weight_high_lbs) that provides information about dog breeds size in height and weight.  There are a total of 149 rows, which is more than the other dataset.
149 rows

Dog_intelligence.csv
This dataset has 5 data columns (Breed, Classification, obey, reps_lower, reps_upper) that need to be examined closer to see if they are all providing the information we need for this project.  There are a total of  135 rows, which is less breeds than the other dataset.

There is the possibility of adding a column for AKC Group designation to also examine its correlation to dog’s obedience and intelligence.

These datasets can possibly be merged on dog breeds, after getting a better understanding of the datasets, to use for the project.  The website linked above has some analysis of the datasets that need to be explored.
